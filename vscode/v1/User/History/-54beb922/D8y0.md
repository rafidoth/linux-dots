# Computer Architecture (CSE 3313)
This disicipline studies the structure of computer system made from component parts. Three main subcatagories.

- Instruction Set Architecute (ISA)
- Microarchitecture
- Systems Design



## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
<strong>Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</strong> is the fundamental interface between software and hardware in a computer system. It defines the set of instructions a processor can understand and execute. It varies for different processors. x86, ARM, PowerPC, MIPS etc are differnt ISAs for different processors. 


<strong>MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)</strong> is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architectures (ISA) developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States.
