### Interfaces

The time when I need to tell a type that you are eligible as a parameter of a certain function if you have these required abilities in other words you have implementation of this interface. Something like an agreement between function and parameters eligibility.

- a set of methods and a type,
- it is used for defining the behavior of other types.
